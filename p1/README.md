## Game planning
### Set up

- Create a deck of cards
  - Create an array of 52 cards
  - Shuffle cards with randomizer
- Create two players
  - Deal cards one per player until entire deck is dealt
    - Create one new array per player containing the players hands
- The players do not know what is in their hand
  - Count and display the total cards in each player's hand
  - The hands will not be displayed on the HTML page

### Game play

- While jack is not present
  - Players discard 1 card each into the center pile
    - Create array for pile of cards from discarded player cards
- When jack is present
  - Both players immediately try to slap the jack
    - Generate random slap winner
  - The winning player accumulates to their hand all cards in the pile
    - Add all cards in pile to winning player's array

**Repeat game play until all cards are accumulated by one player.**
